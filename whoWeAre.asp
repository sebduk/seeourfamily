<h1>See Our Family</h1>

<p>
See Our Family is a small home-based Internet Solution Editor.<br>
We developed the first version of this site in 1998 in Paris, France for our own family.<br>
Following growing attention from relatives and friends we decided in 2004 to make the site 
available to all by further developing the interface and making it available online.<br>
