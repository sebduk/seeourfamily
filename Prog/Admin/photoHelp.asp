Pictures should be uploaded with their thumbnails. 
Thumbnails are small versions of pictures used in the picture lists. These are resized to be lighter and fit a list view. 
To create a thumbnail resize your picture to have its largest dimension (height or width) at 100 pixels keeping the same ratio. 
If your picture is called MyPicture.jpg name the thumbnail MyPicture.tn.jpg (.tn.gif) and upload it with the original using the <b>Add a Picture</b> screen.
